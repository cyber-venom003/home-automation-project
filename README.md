#  :globe_with_meridians: IoT Home Automation Project

An IoT project prototype for automating the control of home using NodeMCU.

Uploaded code right now supports: 
-[x] Appliance Control Using 4 channel SPDT Relay Module
-[x] Secured Access of Appliances using EM-18 RFID Access control

## Working Algorithm
>NodeMCU constantly reads the Firebase Realtime Database in every 2 seconds.
>If the user is authenticated by RFID Access, then devices connected to relays can be triggered accordingly with an Android app designed in Flutter.
